Data:   Piece of information

        We need to store all data somewhere, in an organized manner, where it is

            -   secure,
            -   easy to ready,
            -   fast to read,
            -   easy and fast to update.


Database:   Systematic collection of data

            • Database is a systematic collection of data.
            • Databases support storage and manipulation of data.
            • Databases make data management easy.

            Database we use, stores the all data in tables

    We have 2 types of databases:

    Relational Database: Tables are related to each other using Primary and Foreign keys

                Primary Key: Unique value for each line of data

                                -   PK can not be empty or null
                                -   PK can not be duplicate

                Foreign Key: The Primary Key of another table that is used in another table

    Non-Relational Database: All Data are in Key & Value format (like JSON format)


Database Management System

    •Creates, maintains and organizes the database
    •Easier to manage the database
    •Improves the availability of the information
    •Does have backup system

RDBMS: Relational Database Management System

    • All RDBMS using SQL language
    • Relational Database --> tables are related to each other using Primary and Foreign keys
