• SQL - > STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE

• SQL is a language that is used to work with Databases and manipulate data.

SQL is combined with four languages:
    •Data Query Language(DQL)
    •Data Definition Language (DDL)
    •Data Control Language (DCL)
    •Data Manipulation Language (DML):

Query:  Set of instructions
        Telling Database Management System that what we would like to do.

Data types in SQL Queries:

    -   Int & Integer : whole numbers
    -   Decimal : decimal numbers
    -   Varchar : string
    -   Date : YYYY-MM-DD
    -   Timestamp : YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
    -   Boolean : true & false, Boolean expressions

SQL STATEMENTS

    • First, we specify a list of columns in the table from which we want to query data in the SELECT statement. We use a comma between each column in case we want to query data from multiple columns.
    • If we want to query data from all column, we can use an asterisk ( * ) as the shorthand for all columns.
    • Second, we indicate the table name after the FROM keyword
    • SQL language is case INSENSITIVE

    example: SELECT column1, column2 FROM tableName;

SELECT STATEMENT

• SELECT * FROM TableName;
• SELECT ColumnName FROM TableName;
• SELECT ColumnName1, ColumnName2 ... FROM TableName;
• SELECT Column(s) FROM TableName1, TableName2 ;


DISTINCT

• The DISTINCT keyword can be used to return only distinct (different) values.

        SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2… FROM table name ;


WHERE STATEMENT

• The WHERE clause appears right after the FROM clause of the SELECT statement.
• The conditions are used to filter the rows returned from the SELECT statement.
• SQL provides us with various standard operators to construct the conditions.

        SELECT column_1, column_2.. column_n
        FROM table_name
        WHERE conditions;


Where statement operators: = < > >= <= <> != AND OR

COUNT STATEMENT

• The COUNT function returns the number of input rows that match a specific condition of a query.

            How many departments do we have ?

• Similar to the COUNT(*) function, the COUNT(column) function returns the number of rows returned by a SELECT clause.
• However, it does not consider NULL values in the column.

• We can also use COUNT with DISTINCT, for example;

        How many unique name we have ?
